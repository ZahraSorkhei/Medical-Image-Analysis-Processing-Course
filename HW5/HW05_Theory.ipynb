        "Intensity inhomogeneity (IIH) in images is a phenomenon that occurs when the intensity between adjacent pixels is different. It can be caused by various factors, such as occlusion, uneven heat dissipation, lighting conditions, or imaging devices. IIH can affect the quality and accuracy of image segmentation, which is a process of dividing an image into meaningful regions or objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "One of the methods to deal with IIH is the active contour model (ACM), which is a technique that uses a curve or surface to evolve towards the object boundaries by minimizing an energy functional. The energy functional usually consists of three terms: a region fitting term, a smoothness term, and an external force term.\n",
        "\n",
        "There are several possible causes of intensity inhomogeneity in MRI, such as:\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "*   Imperfections of the image acquisition process, such as nonuniform radiofrequency coils, gradient field nonlinearity, eddy currents, etc.\n",
        "*   Irregular anatomical areas, such as shoulder, hips, ankles, etc. that cause magnetic susceptibility artifacts.\n",
        "*   Presence of metallic objects or implants that distort the magnetic field.\n",
        "*   Patient motion or breathing that introduce motion artifacts.\n",
        "\n",
        "However, the traditional ACMs may not work well for images with IIH, because they assume that the intensity within each region is homogeneous or can be corrected by a bias field. Therefore, some modified ACMs have been proposed to handle IIH more effectively. One of them is the adaptive fuzzy c-means clustering (AFCM) method, which is based on the fuzzy c-means (FCM) algorithm.\n",
        "\n",
        "The FCM algorithm is a clustering method that assigns each pixel to one or more clusters based on its similarity to the cluster centers. The similarity is measured by a membership function, which indicates the degree of belongingness of each pixel to each cluster. The FCM algorithm iteratively updates the cluster centers and the membership functions until they converge.\n",
        "\n",
        "The AFCM method extends the FCM algorithm by introducing an adaptive penalty term and a spatial constraint term into the objective function. The adaptive penalty term penalizes the pixels that have large intensity differences from their cluster centers, while the spatial constraint term incorporates the spatial information of neighboring pixels into the membership function. These two terms help to reduce the effect of IIH and noise on the segmentation results.\n",
        "\n",
        "The AFCM method can be combined with an ACM to form a hybrid model for image segmentation. The AFCM method provides an initial segmentation and an intensity inhomogeneity correction for the ACM, while the ACM refines the segmentation and enforces the boundary smoothness. The hybrid model can achieve better segmentation performance than either method alone."

This goal can be achieved by using a potential function $ p(s) $ with a minimum point $ s=1 $,such that the level set regularization term $ R_p(\\phi)$is minimized when$|\\nabla {\\phi } |=1 $.Therefore, the potential function should have a minimum point at $ s=1 $ (it may have other minimum points).

To avoid this side effect, we introduce a new potential function $ p $ in the distance regularization term$ R_p $. This new potential function is aimed to maintain the signed distance property $  |\\nabla _{\\phi } |=1 $ only in a vicinity of the zero level set, while keeping the LSF as a constant, with $  |\\nabla _{\\phi } |=0 $, at locations far away from the zero level set. To maintain such a profile of the LSF, the potential function $ p(s) $ must have minimum points $ s=0 $ at and $ s=1 $.

The paper proposes a new variational level set formulation that does not require the initial level set function to be a signed distance function, as long as it is close to a signed distance function near the zero level set. This means that the initial level set function can have any shape or topology, and it can be defined on a coarse grid and then interpolated to a finer grid. The paper also suggests some methods for generating the initial level set function, such as using a binary mask, a smoothed mask, or a Gaussian kernel.
